I am a postdoctoral fellow with the Missouri Prevention Science Institute at the University of Missouri. My overarching research goal is to facilitate the thoughtful application of advanced quantitative methods. My current research focuses on two decision points in the statistical modeling process: model specification and model evaluation. On the specification end of the process, I focus on advancing our understanding of the role of prior distributions in Bayesian analyses. On the evaluation end of the process, I examine how we can use alternatives to goodnesss-of-fit testing to better evaluate the validity of our models. More broadly speaking, I am interested in models of development, structural equation modeling, and Bayesian estimation.
