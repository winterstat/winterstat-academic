abstract: "The choice of prior specification plays a vital role in any Bayesian analysis. Prior-data disagreement occurs when the researcherâ€™s prior knowledge is not in agreement with the evidence provided by the data. We examined the ability of the Data Agreement Criterion (DAC) and Bayes Factor (BF) to detect prior-data disagreement in SEM through a simulation study. The design included four sample size levels and 49 prior specifications. Findings suggested that prior-data disagreement still affects posterior estimates when samples are relatively large. Further, comparing multiple prior specifications sheds more light on the presence of prior-data disagreement than assessing a single prior specification. The DAC was easy to implement but cannot assess interactions between priors within one specification. The BF takes these interactions into account, resulting in a global assessment of prior-data disagreement. However, the BF became challenging to compute with larger sample sizes. Implications for applied researchers are discussed."
